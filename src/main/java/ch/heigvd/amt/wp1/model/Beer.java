/**
 * This is a model class. Something that is often called a Plain Old Java Object
 * (POJO). 
 * 
 * Something that is also called a Java Bean (not an Enterprise Java Bean!),
 * because it follows certain conventions for method names. You will notice that
 * for each property, there is a method starting with "get". This is what is called
 * a "getter" function. Later in the course, we will talk about reflection (the ability
 * to dynamically inspect and manipulate objects and classes from your code). You will
 * understand why it is useful to have this type of conventions at this point.
 * 
 * Note that we have not defined "setter" methods for this Java Bean. In general, it
 * is a good practice to work with immutable objects. Until you have the need for changing
 * the state of an object after its creation, you should use this approach.
