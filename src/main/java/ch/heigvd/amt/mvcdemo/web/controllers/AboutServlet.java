/**
 * This is a controller servlet. Notice the @WebServlet annotation at the class
 * level. This is how Inversion of Control (IoC) is implemented in this case.
 *
 * It is an alternative to the method used by other servlets in the project,
 * which declare the information in the web.xml deployment descriptor.
 *
 * The annotation states that whenever the application server receives an HTTP
 * request with a URL equal to "/pages/about", it should invoke the callback
 * method implemented by this class.
 *
 * As specified by the MVC design pattern, the servlet does not generate any
 * HTML itself. Rather, it delegates this task to a JSP page. The
 * RequestDispatcher class of the Servlet API is used for that purpose.
 * 
 * Note that in this case, there is no model involved. In other words, the
 * servlet does not prepare any data that would be made available to the JSP
 * view. In other words, the JSP will only display static content.
