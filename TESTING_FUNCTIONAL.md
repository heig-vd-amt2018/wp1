# Automated functional tests

## Setting tests environnement

Automated functionnal tests are made with Fluentlenium, which is *a website automation framework which extends Selenium to write reliable and resilient UI functional tests.* Read more about it [here](http://fluentlenium.org/).

Dependencies are already set in the pom.xml file.

Fluentlenium is configured to work with Chrome. To run the tests it is required to download the [Chrome driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and place it in the wp1/application folder.

Fluentlenium tests are located under wp1/src/test/java/ch.heigvd.amt.wp1/fluentlenium :

* Wp1FluentScenario1Test.java contains a UI test scenario

* *Wp1FluentTest.java* contains small UI tests
* the subdirectory *pages* contains usefull constants and functions related to each page of the website, helping tests management over time.



## Available tests

#### Statements

* Tests modify the database and change its sate
* Database is wiped each time it is restarted
